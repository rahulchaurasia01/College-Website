<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saraswati College of Engineering is a premier engineering institution, established for the purpose of imparting state 
of art technical education to newly aspired engineers of the 21st Century. We dream to be a leading research organization 
with a dream and vision of creating a knowledgeable society. The foundation of Saraswati College of Engineering was laid 
on 17th September 2004 and since then the college has been growing leaps and bounds. The growth of any worthwhile endeavor, 
especially in the field of education depends to a considerable extent on the selfless service and dedication of the people
 working for it. The most important feature of the Saraswati Education Society and Saraswati College of Engineering, which 
is quite different from other such organizations is that it is based on collective effort made by every individual, working 
with a spirit of team work. Long term planning, meaningful administration and a dedicated and experienced work force, a full 
fledged library and well equipped laboratories are few of our strong points which are worth mentioning.
